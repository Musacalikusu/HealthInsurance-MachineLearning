# Health Insurance Premium Factors

Many factors influence the cost of health insurance premiums, and it's essential to understand what these factors are. This repository provides information about various determinants affecting health insurance premiums.

## Factors

### Age
The age of the primary beneficiary is a significant factor influencing health insurance premiums. Generally, older individuals tend to have higher premiums compared to younger individuals.

### Gender
Gender also plays a role in determining health insurance premiums. In some cases, insurers may charge different rates based on gender.

### BMI (Body Mass Index)
BMI, which is calculated from a person's weight and height, provides insight into body weight relative to height. Individuals with higher BMIs may face higher premiums.

### Children
The number of children covered by health insurance or the number of dependents can impact premium costs. Insuring more dependents may result in higher premiums.

### Smoking Status
Smoking is a well-known risk factor for various health conditions. Insurers often charge higher premiums for smokers due to increased health risks associated with smoking.

### Region
The residential area of the beneficiary in the US can affect premium costs. Different regions may have varying healthcare costs and insurance regulations, leading to differences in premiums.
